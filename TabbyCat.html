	<h2>Everything you need to know about Tabby Cats.</h2>

	<h3>What is a Tabby Cat?</h3>
	<p>What is a Tabby cat? “Tabby” is not a breed but a coat pattern in cats. Its appearance can vary slightly from stripes to whorls, spots, and more.
	These variations all have their own names, but often an “M” shaped marking appears on the head of Tabby cats, just above the eyes. The Tabby pattern can be seen across a wide range of purebred cats and in mixed breed cats.</p><br>

	<h3>History of Tabby Cats</h3>
	<p>Where do Tabby cats come from? When it comes to the Tabby cat origin, it’s thought that the array of Tabby patterns seen today all started with the mackerel pattern, which is the natural coat pattern of the African wildcat. The distinct ‘M’ marking on a Tabby’s forehead is thought by some to stand for either ‘Mau,’ which is the Egyptian word for ‘cat,’ the Virgin Mary, or also Mohammed, who is said to have loved Tabbies.
	Other Tabby patterns came about from selective breeding and mutations of mackerel Tabby cats.</p><br>

	<h3>Fur Patterns</h3>
	<p>There are now five different Tabby coat patterns, making many unique-looking Tabby cats to choose as your companion!</p>
	<ul>
		<li><strong>Classic Tabby</strong></li>

		<p>The classic Tabby pattern is made up of whorls that create a shape resembling a target on the side of the cat. The classic Tabby is sometimes referred to as a “blotched Tabby.”</p>
		<li><strong>Mackerel Tabby</strong></li>

		<p>Mackerel Tabby cats have rings around their tails and legs and bands of solid or broken stripes around the rest of their body.</p>
		<li><strong>Spotted Tabby</strong></li>

		<p>Instead of having bands of stripes, spotted Tabby cats have bands of spots. The spots vary in size and can resemble broken stripes similar to those of a mackerel Tabby.</p>
		<li><strong>Patched Tabby</strong></li>

		<p>Patched Tabbies have patches (hence the name) of dark or grayish brown and patches of red or orange with the Tabby pattern throughout both colors. They are often referred to as Tortoiseshell (or Tortie) Tabbies because the brown and orange spots are like those seen on the shell of a tortoise.</p>
		<li><strong>Ticked Tabby</strong></li>
		<img src="https://d3544la1u8djza.cloudfront.net/APHI/Blog/2021/10-07/Abyssinian+cat%2C+or+ticked+tabby%2C+sleeping-min.jpg" height="150" width="200" class="tabby2">
		<p>You won’t see bands of stripes or spots on a ticked Tabby (otherwise known as Abyssinian Tabby or agouti Tabby cats), except possibly on their legs. But, if you look at their individual hairs closely, you’ll notice that each of them has bands of light and dark coloring.<br>
		Ticked Tabby cats also have the signature Tabby “M” on their head.</p><br>

	</ul>

	<h3>Tabby Cat Health</h3>
	<p>The health of Tabby cats can vary depending on their breed, but their average life expectancy can be upward of 15 years. The most common health conditions reported by ASPCA Pet Health Insurance pet parents with Tabby cats are hyperthyroidism, vomiting, urinary trouble, upset stomach, and weight loss.<br>

	One of the best ways to look after your feline’s health is to take them for annual check-ups with their veterinarian. These yearly appointments are an ideal time for you to talk with your veterinarian about any questions or concerns you may have about your cat’s health, behavior, and lifestyle. Visits to the veterinarian are also an ideal time for your pal to be updated on any necessary shots.<br>

	Even if your cat appears to be in great health, it is essential that you do not cancel or skip their examinations. Cats are notorious for being naturally lethargic animals, so it can be difficult to tell with your bare eyes whether they are sick.</p>
